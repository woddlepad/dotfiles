# My dotfile Config

## NeoVim
My nvim config is in a different repo [here](https://github.com/woddlepad/lazy-neovim). Mostly just LazyVim, which is fitting as I was too lazy to configure too much here. Mostly just adding flutter support and some remaps.

## Sketchy Bar ![github](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) 
Nice status bar. Just copied the example config with some color edits.

## JankyBorders ![github](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBordersSketchyBar)
Nice Borders around the active window.

## Karabiner Elements 
Switching important apps. (Could be replaced with SKHD)

## yabai - WM ![github](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) 
The best WM in mac os


## SKHD ![github](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) 
all yabai shortcuts

## Kitty Terminal ![github](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) 
Awesome, fast Terminal.

### Setup
Download the kitty-themes ![here](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes).
Then create the soft link to theme.conf E.g. `ln -s ./kitty-themes/themes/Floraverse.conf ~/.config/kitty/theme.conf`
